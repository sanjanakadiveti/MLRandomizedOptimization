How to run code:

All this is in ABAGAIL/src

- Neural Net portion (not just RHC; Apologies for the bad naming.)

	javac Rhc.java
	java Rhc

- Interesting problems:
	
	//contains code for both fourpeaks and flipflop (commented out)
	javac FourPeaksTest.java
	java FourPeaks

	javac TravelingSalesmanTest.java
	java TravelingSalesmanTest


- Graphs:
	python graphs.py 		//graphs for the NN portion 
	python tsgraph.py 		//graphs for traveling salesman
	python ff.py 			//graphs for flip flop
	python peaksgraph.py 	//graphs for 4 peaks
